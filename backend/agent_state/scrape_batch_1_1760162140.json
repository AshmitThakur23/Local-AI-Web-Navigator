The Metro Travel team has rounded up all the strikes set to take place from now until the end of the month, and beyond.\n\n\n\nSpain\n\n\n\nAzul Handling, the company that provides ground handling services to Ryanair Group airlines at several Spanish airports, have been striking since August 15.\n\n\n\nOver 3,000 workers in Spain began campaigning for increased pay, better working conditions, job security, and medical leave. Disputes with overtime were brought up, too.\n\n\n\nStaff will stage strikes from 5am to 9am every Wednesday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday until December 31.\n\n\n\nCanarian Weekly has said Ryanair&#8217;s 12 Spanish bases will be affected: Alicante, Barcelona, Girona, Ibiza, Lanzarote, Madrid, Málaga, Palma de Mallorca, Santiago de Compostela, Sevilla, Tenerife South, and Valencia.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\tAzul Handling are campaigning for better pay and working conditions (Picture: Getty Images)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe outlet said that while the airports aren&#8217;t officially part of the strikes, schedules could experience knock-on delays and cancellations. \n\n\n\nHowever, Ryanair insists there will be no disruption to travellers. The airline said: &#8216;We do not expect any interruption to our operations as a result of these third-party strikes in Spain.&#8217;\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nPassengers travelling through&nbsp;Bournemouth Airport&nbsp;were set to face major disruption due to a series of strikes planned for 30 September, 1 October, 16 October and 17 October.\n\n\n\nAround 80 members of the Unite trade union, who work in different areas of the airport, including baggage handling, check-in, flight dispatching and plane fuelling, were ready to walk out after they rejected a new pay offer.\n\n\n\nBut hours before, the action was suspended after the board of the airport came back with an improved offer.\n\n\n\nBournemouth Airport serves over 950,000 passengers each year, with flights to 34 destinations across Europe and North Africa. Most are operated by airlines such as TUI and Ryanair.\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tLatest European travel news\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\nRyanair rival adds new flights to Canary Island destination just axed by Irish airline\nUK gets new £58 flights to charming city with ‘phenomenal’ food\n\n\n‘Ryanair of trains’ launches new London to Scotland route — with tickets less than £50\nWizz Air axes all UK flights to major European city starting from next month\nAirline launches flights from £9 to European hotspots including Majorca, Alicante and Seville\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\nFrance\n\n\n\nFrench air traffic controllers have called off their upcoming strikes, sparing travellers across Europe from serious disruption.\n\n\n\nFrance&#8217;s biggest&nbsp;air traffic control&nbsp;union, the SNCTA, was due to strike from the morning of Tuesday, 7 October, until the morning of Friday, 10 October.\n\n\n\nOn Saturday, a spokesperson said it would halt its forthcoming industrial action following agreements and the French prime minister&#8217;s postponement of the French finance bill parliamentary debate.\n\n\n\nThe SNCTA told AFP it had &#8216;made progress on internal issues&#8217; and held &#8216;calm discussions with all parties involved,&#8217; without providing further details.\n\n\n\nThe walkout had been due to take place in September, but it was cancelled due to the recent collapse of the French government after Prime Minister Francois Bayrou received a vote of no confidence in Parliament.\n\n\n\nHowever, things may change. On Monday morning, France&#8217;s new Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu resigned — after less than a month in the job.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\tEmmanuel Macron just lost his 7th Prime Minister (Picture: AFP)\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Lecornu&#8217;s resignation comes hours after he appointed his cabinet, and after political rivals threatened to topple his government.\n\n\n\nFrance is in the midst of a political deadlock. Lecornu was Macron’s seventh PM.\n\n\n\nHe was appointed on 9 September amid a&nbsp;political crisis&nbsp;when his predecessor,&nbsp;François Bayrou, was dramatically ousted over proposed budget cuts.\n\n\n\nPortugal\n\n\n\nThe Portuguese strikes were shaping up to be more complex, as they were due to continue periodically for the rest of the year and into January 2026.\n\n\n\nBut in good news for travellers, the 76-day action by Menzies Aviation ground staff has just been called off.\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, the workers voted to cancel the strike, saying the imposed minimum service requirements made it impossible to exercise their right to strike effectively.\n\n\n\nThey had been calling for increased pay, better working conditions, employee parking, and night shift compensation. Plus, fulfilment of previously agreed working terms.\n\n\n\n\n  @skyscanner If you&#8217;re travelling to Portugal soon, there could be strikes that may impact your trip. Here&#8217;s what you need to know: Baggage handlers at major airports including Lisbon, Porto, Faro, Madeira and the Azores are threatening to strike every weekend from September 3rd to mid-December. Extra strikes are also planned for Christmas and New Year from December 19th to January 2nd 2026. What does this mean for travellers? If the strikes go ahead you should expect delays at baggage claim, particularly if you&#8217;re travelling on a Friday through to Monday. If you&#8217;re travelling to Portugal soon, we recommend checking with your airline before you fly to see if you might encounter delays. It&#8217;s a good idea to allow some extra time for your delays and also potentially consider flying midweek to avoid strike days. #Portugal #PortugalStrikes #PortugalAirportStrikes #EuropeTravel  ♬ Beat &#8211; beaty   \n\n\n\n\nThe industrial action had been called by SIMA (the Union of Metal and Related Industries) and STA (the Transport Union), targeting Menzies (formerly Groundforce), the company responsible for ground handling services at Portuguese airports.\n\n\n\nHowever, Portugal&#8217;s Arbitration Court, under the Economic and Social Council, ruled that minimum service levels had to be maintained. \n\n\n\nSIMA hit back, calling the decision a &#8216;real attack on the right to strike of Portuguese workers in general and of that company in particular&#8217;.\n\n\n\nItaly\n\n\n\nTo protect holiday travel, strikes are banned during the peak summer season from late July to early September.\n\n\n\nBut now that the window is over, it&#8217;s fair game. On September 26, a 24-hour walkout paralysed Italian air travel, as several aviation strikes took place at once.\n\n\n\nOrganised by the transport union CUB Trasporti, baggage handlers, ground staff, and crew with the Spanish carrier Volotea and Wizz Air Malta downed tools.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\tRyanair maintains that travellers won&#8217;t be affected (Picture: Peter Byrne/PA Wire)\n\n\n\n\n\nSecurity staff at Sardinia&#8217;s Cagliari Elmas Airport also walked out for 24 hours.\n\n\n\nMilan’s Malpensa and Linate airports were the hardest hit, with dozens of flights delayed and cancelled.\n\n\n\nThe strikes are a response to disputes over working conditions, staffing levels across Italy&#8217;s transport sector, and pay disagreements.\n\n\n\nLast month, cities across Italy ground to a standstill as workers staged a sweeping general strike in support of Gaza.\n\n\n\nRailway, port and local public transport networks were severely disrupted until 11pm, across several cities including Rome, Naples, and Milan.\n\n\n\nMetro has contacted Ryanair for comment.\n\n\n\nDo you have a story to share?\n\n\n\nGet in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.",
