That's where the <a href=\"#section-the-best-budget-laptop-overall\">Acer Aspire Go 15</a> (for Windows 11) and <a href=\"#section-the-best-cheap-macbook\">MacBook Air M1</a> (for macOS) come in handy, as they offer decent performance, great battery life and great value for the money. </p><p><strong>Casual use: </strong>If you prefer to have a laptop for browsing websites, binge watching your favorite shows or jotting down a few notes, the good news is you won't have to pay a pretty penny for one. But you'll still want a decent display or even a touchscreen to interact with them far more easily. Chromebooks excel at this, and the <a href=\"#section-the-best-budget-chromebook\">Lenovo Flex 5i Chromebook Plus</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/laptops/lenovo-ideapad-slim-3x-review\">Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3x</a> are fantastic options. The former is more premium (but great for watching shows), while the latter acts as a 2-in-1 that offers versatility. </p><p><strong>Gaming: </strong>If you don't want to break your bank account on a gaming laptop but still want enough power to run popular PC games, especially when it comes to multiplayer titles, getting a machine that offers a strong enough CPU and GPU, along with enough RAM, is essential. Budget laptops won't offer maxed-out graphics in AAA games, but they can still deliver excellent gameplay with smooth visuals. That includes the <a href=\"#section-the-best-budget-gaming-laptop\">MSI Cyborg 15</a> and <a href=\"#section-the-best-budget-gaming-laptop-alternative\">Acer Nitro V 15</a>, which boast RTX 40-series GPUs and surprisingly good performance &mdash; for the price, that is. </p>"

Although those numbers are a tad different for gaming laptops, as anything under $1,000/&pound;1,000 is what you can expect from a budget gaming machine. </p><p>Now, not all budget laptops are worth their low price. Some lean too hard on lackluster components to make up for their cheaper cost, but if it can barely open a Chrome tab or two without stuttering or, even worse, crashing, then there isn't much point in spending money on it. </p><p>Still, there are several laptops that offer a great price-to-performance ratio, and you can find some for around $300/&pound;300 while offering commendable power. If you're only looking for an entry-level machine to get everyday tasks done, then a budget laptop will help you save while also giving you the performance you require. </p>"

              "description": "Asus' Zenbook 14 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) offers good performance, great battery life, and an OLED display—all for a little over $1,000. Now, you might think that sounds a little expensive to be considered a “cheap laptop.\" And it is. But Asus also sells a much cheaper, Intel-powered model called the Zenbook 14 Q415. It's selling for around $600, if you can believe it, as it's a couple of years old. That model comes with less memory but otherwise offers the same portability, port selection, and comfortable keyboard.\nThe more recent AMD-powered model that we tested, however, comes with the AMD Ryzen 7 8840HS with 16 GB of RAM and a 512-GB SSD. We were impressed with the performance, especially given the price, though the fan can get loud. Graphics and gaming aren’t entirely workable, with rather pitiful frame rates throughout, but battery life is outstanding, clocking in at 15 hours (measured by looping a YouTube video at full brightness).\n\n\n\nSpecs\n\n\n\n\nDisplay: 14-inch, 1920 x 1200\n\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 7 8840HS\n\n\nRAM: 16 GB\n\n\nStorage: 512 GB",

But in hardware, the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) makes a serious case for a Chromebook at its price, which starts at $650. While our top pick for best cheap laptop, the Asus Vivobook 14, has broader appeal because it's a Windows device, the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 is an undeniably more enjoyable piece of tech to use.\nIt's better in many ways, including its display, chassis, keyboard, and touchpad. It has close to the same battery life, lasting up to 16 hours in video playback, which is the best battery life I've ever seen on a Chromebook and is right up there with its Mac and Windows rivals. Yes, there are limitations with ChromeOS to consider, but the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 is a winner for tight wallets.\nNote: Lenovo's 12 GB version of this Chromebook is sold exclusively at Lenovo.com, and it is often sold out.\n\n\n\nSpecs\n\n\n\n\nDisplay: 14-inch, 1920 x 1200\n\n\nCPU: MediaTek Kompanio Ultra 910\n\n\nRAM: 12 GB\n\n\nStorage: 256 GB",

The M1 MacBook Air (9/10, WIRED Recommends) from 2020, however, is a rare exception. While it has been superseded by a bevy of more recent Airs, it remains a powerful laptop for the money. Our model is still going strong despite daily use. The battery is in good shape too (surprisingly), still allowing for a full day's work. The one downside is that you can only buy the base model with 8 GB of unified memory and 256 GB of storage. That's fine for basic things like web browsing and document editing, but if you're looking to push it, you'll likely hit some slowdowns. It also has a sharper and more colorful screen than almost any other laptop on this list.\nMake sure you pay no more than $600—we've seen newer M3-powered MacBooks go for as low as $849, or M2-powered MacBooks dip to $750, so it might be worth saving for something more modern.\nRumor has it that Apple may soon launch a new $600 MacBook that replaces the M1 MacBook Air, powered by the A18 iPhone chip. It might be prudent to wait another month or two. Otherwise, the M1 MacBook Air is the best cheap MacBook you can buy right now.\n\n\n\nSpecs\n\n\n\n\nDisplay: 13.3-inch, 2560 x 1600\n\n\nCPU: Apple M1\n\n\nRAM: 8 GB\n\n\nStorage: 256 GB",

Not the Framework Laptop 12 (7/10, WIRED Recommends). Like other Framework computers, the Laptop 12 is completely upgradable, allowing you to access and swap out nearly every internal component. So long as Framework continues to hold up its end of the deal, you could upgrade the Framework Laptop 12 over the years and keep it around through many generations of CPUs. The amazing part is just how easy Framework has made it to install components and upgrade them yourself—it can be done in minutes.\nThe DIY Edition, which doesn't come with RAM and storage, starts at just $549. While the performance and display aren't exactly premium, I was surprised by how high-end the touchpad and keyboard feel.

              "description": "Chromebooks have a reputation for being underpowered. To change that, Google launched Chromebook Plus in 2023, an umbrella category for a new class of devices from various manufacturers. The “Plus” stands for better performance—faster processors, more memory, more storage, and better video cameras. One of my favorites is Lenovo's Flex 5i Chromebook Plus (8/10, WIRED Recommends). It's among the fastest Chromebooks we've tested at this price, featuring an Intel Core i3-1315U CPU, 8 GB of RAM, and 128 GB of flash storage.\nThe Flex 5i has two USB-C ports (one is used for charging) plus one USB-A port. You also get a microSD card slot for expanding the storage capability, making this a good choice for those who don't want to keep everything in the cloud. The 14-inch touchscreen uses a 2-in-1 design, making it ideal for media streaming. As on most Chromebooks, the screen isn't the best, with mid-level brightness and a standard 1,920 x 1,080-pixel screen resolution.\nThere are plenty of other great Chromebook Plus models, so make sure you read our Best Chromebooks guide for more cheap laptops.\n\n\n\nSpecs\n\n\n\n\nDisplay: 14-inch, 1920 x 1200\n\n\nCPU: Intel Core i3-1315U\n\n\nRAM: 8 GB\n\n\nStorage: 128 GB",

              "description": "Lenovo’s Chromebook Duet Gen 9 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) quickly became one of my favorite gadgets of 2024 despite its small size. That’s the whole point with this 11-inch detachable laptop, which is incredibly fun to use around the house and throw in a bag when it’s time to go. The keyboard detaches from the screen, so it makes for a nice tablet when paired with ChromeOS's Android apps, and then you can get some work done when you attach the keyboard. At nearly 10 hours on average, its battery life will easily get you through the day, too.\nIt's powered by a battery-sipping MediaTek Kompanio 838 processor that can handle more than 10 Chrome tabs open at a time. The small keyboard and trackpad require an adjustment if you’re coming from a full-size keyboard, but they’re also what help it stay portable. The included Lenovo Pen is great as well for signing documents or doodling, and you can easily dock it out of the way on the back of the display when you don’t need it.\n\n\n\nSpecs\n\n\n\n\nDisplay: 10.9-inch, 1920 x 1200\n\n\nCPU: MediaTek Kompanio 838\n\n\nRAM: 4 GB\n\n\nStorage: 64 GB",

              "description": "Cheap laptops tend to skimp on the display. Not the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus (8/10, WIRED Recommends). It sports a 15.6-inch AMOLED screen, the same type you'll find on all sorts of premium Windows laptops. It looks fantastic, with vivid colors and details—a huge step up from almost every other laptop at this price.\nBeyond just the display, it's also just 0.47 inches thick and 2.58 pounds. That’s less than half an inch, making it the thinnest and lightest Chromebook Plus you can get right now. The Intel Core i3-100U processor, meanwhile, handles ChromeOS with ease. This is also one of the few Chromebooks with Google’s Quick Insert key, which gives you easy access to shortcuts for accessing GIFs and emoji, a list of recently opened websites, AI tools, and integrated Google Drive search, among other things.\n\n\n\nSpecs\n\n\n\n\nDisplay: 15.6-inch, 1920 x 1080\n\n\nCPU: Intel Core 3 100U\n\n\nRAM: 8 GB\n\n\nStorage: 256 GB",
