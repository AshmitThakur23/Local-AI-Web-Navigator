I generally recommend the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-laptops#section-the-best-laptop-overall\">MacBook Air M4</a> (macOS) or the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-laptops#section-the-best-windows-laptop\">Dell XPS 13</a> (Windows 11) for this, and you can upgrade to models with bigger screens if you want more room to work. If you're technical and like the idea of upgrading and repairing your own laptop, I wholeheartedly recommend you check out the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-laptops#section-the-best-laptop-to-repair-and-upgrade\">Framework Laptop</a> instead since you can modify and upgrade it for as long as you own it, in a way that no other laptop can match.</p><p><strong>Gaming: </strong>If you plan to spend a lot of time gaming, you want a laptop with a speedy CPU, a discrete laptop graphics card and plenty of RAM. If you plan to play at higher than 60 frames per second, a screen with a high refresh rate is also great. Personally, I recommend the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-laptops#section-the-best-gaming-laptop\">Asus ROG Zephyrus G14</a> since it satisfies all these requirements.</p><p><strong>Creative work: </strong>If you plan to do a lot of 3D work, video editing or demanding content creation you will want a laptop that's very similar to a gaming laptop, with a powerful CPU, a discrete GPU and plenty of RAM to handle demanding workloads. But you also want a sharp, color-accurate screen, which is why I generally recommend the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-laptops#section-the-best-macbook-pro\">MacBook Pro (14-inch M4)</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-laptops#section-the-best-macbook-pro-alternative\">Asus ProArt P16</a>.</p><p><strong>Casual use: </strong>If you just need a laptop for basic writing, browsing the web and binge-watching your favorite shows, you can save yourself a lot of money with a budget-friendly laptop. I recommend the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-laptops#section-the-best-value-laptop\">Acer Aspire Go 15 </a>if you prefer Windows, or the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-laptops#section-the-best-chromebook\">Lenovo Flex 5i Chromebook Plus</a> if you're okay with a Chromebook and have reliable access to Wi-Fi (because Chromebooks can't do much without an Internet connection).</p>"

Only Windows laptops come with features like touchscreens, high-speed displays or the option to transform into a tablet. However, they typically have worse battery life than the best MacBooks. </p><p><strong>Buy a Chromebook if </strong>your work and entertainment needs revolve entirely around a browser.

But we know they're not going to be the best options for everyone! If you're shopping around for something more suited to your tastes, here's how our team go about finding stellar savings.</p><p>First things first, establish what you're looking to buy and set a budget. It's easy to watch costs spiral and before you know it, you've dropped thousands of dollars on additional power and features you may not need. Figuring out what you want to do with your laptop and how much money you're comfortable spending is the best option. For example, saying \"I want a good gaming laptop for under $1,000\" will net you a whole host of great budget-to-mid-range choices.</p><p>Second, retailers are going to work really hard to make its deals look super attractive with huge percentage discounts, but don't fall for it. I've already spotted numerous deals that have actually been cheaper in the past.</p><p>As a good sense check for this, take a look at downloading <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-camelizer/ghnomdcacenbmilgjigehppbamfndblo\" target=\"_blank\">the Camelizer</a> &mdash; a Chrome extension that can run an extensive historical price check on any Amazon product. With that line graph, you can see whether that laptop deal is actually a deal.</p><p>And finally, within your choice, have a think about what particular features of a laptop matter to you. If you're someone who cares about screen real estate, the choice is obvious. But if you can really stretch the graphical capabilities of that silicon with your workload, think again.</p><p>Or maybe you want the vastly increased amount of app support and customization opportunities of Windows 11, which will also net you better value for money than the MacBooks, but also lacks the simplicity of macOS. Just take a breather, think about what things matter &mdash; the software, the keyboard being good to type on, etc &mdash; and make the best judgement for you.</p>"

                "text": "Definitely. Despite what the big brands think, not everyone has the budget for a brand new laptop every few years. Purchasing a refurbished laptop will save you some money while also giving life to a perfectly good machine.   If you're worried about its performance, don't be. There's a big difference between \"used\" and \"refurbished\", with the latter meaning the device has gone through a quality control check by experts to make sure everything is up to par.   That means the hardware has been verified to be in good shape (and replaced, if need be) and the software/operating system are in working order. Just keep in mind that refurbished laptops often come with the hardware they shipped with, so it's not going to be the newest, top-of-the-line components. You'll still get a device that will suit your needs, though, and saving hundreds of dollars in the process.&nbsp;One of the main things to look out for with refurbished laptops is the warranty it comes with. You'll want to make sure you have at least a year of coverage, but preferably more, in case something breaks down or you need a repair.   You can purchase a refurbished laptop at reputable resellers like Backmarket and eBay, but the big brands like Dell and Lenovo also have their own refurbished sites, which we highly recommend, as they often put a little more care into their own products. &nbsp;"

                "text": "Laptops come in a variety of different form factors these days, with manufacturers playing into the different categories to develop an intended use case. For example, lightweight laptops are made to be carried around, and trade in some raw power for portability. 2-in-1 laptops come with touchscreens that allow for use as a tablet. The best form factor for you reflects how you think you'll use the device.&nbsp;Lightweight/ultraportable laptopsMade for students, hybrid workers, and anyone who needs to commute with their laptop. These devices have seen a huge explosion in the past few years, becoming thinner and lighter than ever. Some good examples are the Asus Zenbook A14, the Apple MacBook Air M4, and the Lenovo ThinkPad X9 Aura Edition -- all devices we've tested and love for their ultraportable forms relative to power and battery life.&nbsp;Business laptopsDesigned for the office, these laptops often come with more RAM and local storage, but less powerful GPUs. Their physical designs are often sleek, neutral, and corporate, and they feature lots of ports for compatibility purposes. Premium work laptops may have extra touches like OLED screens (like the HP EliteBook X G1a) or haptic trackpads (Lenovo's   ThinkPad X9 Aura Edition) to match the high-end hardware.&nbsp;2-in-1 laptopsAlso called convertibles, these laptops allow for the screen to be folded all the way back so it can act as a tablet or be used in \"tent mode\" to display media. Some 2-in-1 laptops we're big fans of are the Lenovo Yoga 7i 2-in-1 16&nbsp;and the Dell 16 Plus 2-in-1.&nbsp;Gaming LaptopsAs the name suggests, these are laptops made to run games, and as such come with the hardware to support that. We're talking high-end GPUs, large, vivid displays, and often, RGB lighting and other physical design effects that set them apart from business laptops.&nbsp;While they're designed to run the latest titles, they also can double as good machines for creatives thanks to their high-end hardware, and as such, tend to be pricier. Some gaming laptops we love are the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i and the   Alienware Area-51m 18.&nbsp;MacBooksApple's line of MacBooks are premium devices with a host of features that integrate into the Apple ecosystem. The hardware on MacBooks is arguably some of the best in the industry, with things like gorgeous Liquid Retina displays, crisp, clear webcams, and Apple's line of Silicon processors, which have some of the most impressive performance on the market. The trade-off is the cost, which start around the $1,000 mark and go upwards from there.&nbsp;ChromebooksGoogle's Chromebook lineup uses its own operating system -- ChromeOS -- to power its lineup of light and affordable laptops. Putting a streamlined, limited OS onto a laptop with modest hardware means you forgo the sprawling memory demands of Windows, and run 8GB of RAM smoothly and efficiently.&nbsp;We're big fans of Chromebooks at ZDNET, with some of our favorites being the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14, the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus, and the Acer Chromebook Plus 516 GE.&nbsp;"
